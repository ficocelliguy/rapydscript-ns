## Detailed Notes on Key Differences

### Function Argument Validation

RapydScript intentionally does **not** raise `TypeError` for:
- Calling a function with too few arguments (extra params are `undefined`)
- Calling a function with too many arguments (extras silently discarded)
- Passing a positional-only parameter by keyword (named kwarg silently ignored)
- Passing a keyword-only parameter positionally (no error raised)
- Specifying an optional argument twice when `*args` is present

**Rationale:** Performance and interoperability with JavaScript libraries that
frequently call functions with varying argument patterns.

### Dict Defaults (JavaScript Object Semantics)

Without `from __python__ import dict_literals, overload_getitem`:
- `{...}` creates a plain JS object, not a Python dict
- Missing keys return `undefined`, not `KeyError`
- Numeric keys are silently coerced to strings: `d[1]` and `d['1']` are the same key
- Dict keys are also accessible as properties: `d.foo == d['foo']`
- No `.keys()`, `.values()`, `.items()`, `.get()`, `.pop()` methods

Use `from __python__ import dict_literals, overload_getitem` for full Python dict semantics.

### List Method Name Conflicts (Resolved)

RapydScript lists are native JavaScript arrays. The method naming has been
restored to match Python conventions:
- `list.sort()` — Python numeric sort (in-place, supports `key` and `reverse`)
- `list.pop()` — Python bounds-checked pop (raises `IndexError` for out-of-bounds)
- `list.jssort()` — native JS lexicographic sort (for JS interop)
- `list.jspop()` — native JS pop (no bounds check, ignores arguments)
- `list.pysort()` / `list.pypop()` — backward-compat aliases for `sort()`/`pop()`

### Truthiness

Default truthiness follows JavaScript rules:
- `[]`, `{}`, any non-null object → **truthy** (unlike Python)
- `0`, `''`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN` → falsy

Enable Python truthiness with `from __python__ import truthiness`:
- Empty containers (`[]`, `{}`, `set()`, `''`) → falsy
- `__bool__` and `__len__` dunders are dispatched

### String Method Availability

Python string methods are available via the `str` object:
```python
str.strip('  hello  ')   # 'hello'
str.split('a b')         # ['a', 'b']
```

To make them available on string instances, call `from pythonize import strings; strings()`.
However, `split()` and `replace()` are **always** the JS versions — Python semantics
for these two methods must be accessed via `str.split(s)` / `str.replace(s, ...)`.

Notable JS-vs-Python difference for `split()`:
- Python `'a  b'.split()` → `['a', 'b']` (splits on any whitespace, strips leading/trailing)
- JS `'a  b'.split()` → `['a  b']` (no-arg form returns single-element array)

### Method Binding

RapydScript **does not** auto-bind methods to instances. This matches
JavaScript semantics but differs from Python:
```python
obj = MyClass()
obj.method()          # ✓ works — 'self' is correctly set
f = obj.method
f()                   # ✗ 'self' is undefined/window (unbound)
```

Use `from __python__ import bound_methods` inside a class to enable auto-binding.

### `global` Keyword Scope

RapydScript's `global` keyword slightly differs from Python's: if a variable
exists in an intermediate outer function scope **and** in the module-level
(global) scope, the outer function scope variable takes precedence.
In Python, `global` always refers to the module-level scope.

### `is` Operator

`is` compiles to `===` (strict equality), not Python's object identity check.
This means:
- `1 is 1` is `True` (same as Python)
- `'a' is 'a'` is `True` (same as Python for interned strings)
- `[1] is [1]` is `False` (same as Python — different objects)
- But `NaN is NaN` is `False` in JS (`NaN !== NaN`), which differs from Python

### Ordering Operators on Containers

RapydScript does **not** overload `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` for lists or other
containers. These fall through to JS comparison which coerces to strings:
```python
[10] < [9]    # True in RapydScript (JS: '10' < '9' string compare)
              # False in Python (numeric element comparison)
```
Use explicit element comparisons or define `__lt__` etc. and call them directly.

### Regular Expressions

The `re` module wraps JavaScript's regex engine. Key limitations:
1. **Lookbehind** — not supported in ES5; may work in ES6+ environments
2. **Unicode** — non-BMP characters may require ES6 `u` flag
3. **`MatchObject.start()`/`.end()`** for sub-groups — incorrect for some
   nested-capture patterns (JS doesn't expose sub-group positions directly)

### Generators

By default, generators compile to ES5 state-machine switch statements (larger
but widely compatible). Pass `--js-version 6` to emit native ES6 generators.

## Features Completely Absent (not in Python either, but noteworthy)

| Feature | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `v'...'` verbatim JS | RapydScript-only; embeds raw JS |
| Existential operator `x?.y` | Borrowed from CoffeeScript |
| `?` null-coalescing shorthand `a = b ? c` | RapydScript-specific |
| `def` as expression | Assign anonymous multi-line functions |
| `.call(this)` chaining syntax | Invoke anonymous functions immediately |

## Recommendations for Improving Python Compatibility

The following improvements are prioritized by how frequently they surprise Python users and how disruptive the gap is in practice. Items marked 🔥 are silent footguns — they produce wrong behavior with no error, making them especially harmful.


### 7. Add Stub Modules for `typing`, `dataclasses`, and `enum`

**Current:** `typing`, `dataclasses`, and `enum` are completely absent.

**Recommendation:**
- **`typing`**: Add a stub `src/lib/typing.pyj` that exports `List`, `Dict`, `Optional`, `Union`, `Tuple`, `Any`, `TypeVar`, `Generic`, `Callable` — all as no-ops or identity functions. This lets users write `from typing import Optional, List` without import errors, and allows type-annotated Python code to run unchanged.
- **`enum`**: Add a basic `Enum` base class where `class Color(Enum): RED = 1` creates an object with `.name` and `.value` attributes, iteration over members, and `Color.RED` access. This is well-defined behavior with no JS-fundamental blockers.
- **`dataclasses`**: Add a `@dataclass` decorator that introspects class-level annotations and generates `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__`. This is a high-value feature — dataclasses are ubiquitous in modern Python and could be implemented in ~100 lines of RapydScript using the existing annotation support.

**Why:** These three modules are among the most-imported in modern Python codebases. Their absence means entire categories of modern Python patterns — type hints, structured data classes, enumerated constants — fail at import time with no workaround other than rewriting the code.

---

### 8. Add a `copy` Module (`copy.copy` / `copy.deepcopy`)

**Current:** No `copy` module. Shallow and deep copy must be done via JS idioms (`Object.assign`, `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(...))`) or verbatim JS.

**Recommendation:** Add `src/lib/copy.pyj` with:
- `copy(obj)` — shallow clone: spread for plain objects, `.slice()` for arrays, class instance duplication via `Object.assign(Object.create(proto), obj)`.
- `deepcopy(obj)` — deep clone: recursive traversal for plain objects/arrays; use `structuredClone()` (ES2022) when available with a recursive fallback.

**Why:** `copy.deepcopy` is one of the most commonly needed utilities when porting Python code. Many algorithms depend on working with independent copies of mutable data structures. Without it, users either introduce subtle aliasing bugs or write verbose verbatim-JS workarounds.

### Summary: Priority Order

| Priority | Item | Effort | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fix list `+` concatenation (silent footgun) | Low — compiler emit change | 🔥 High |
| 2 | ~~Rename `pysort`/`pypop` back to `sort`/`pop`~~ | ✅ Done | 🔥 High |
| 3 | Default Python truthiness | Medium — flag change + regression test | 🔥 High |
| 4 | Default Python dicts | Medium — compiler flag or config | High |
| 5 | Python string methods on instances | Low — fix `strings()` split/replace | High |
| 6 | `typing`, `dataclasses`, `enum` stubs | Medium — ~200 lines per module | High |
| 7 | `copy` module | Low — ~80 lines | Medium |
| 8 | `__getattr__`/`__setattr__` via Proxy | High — ES6 only, code-gen complexity | Medium |
